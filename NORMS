1NF:
  1. No repeating groups
  2. Data values are unique
  3. Field names are unique
  4. The relation has a primary key
  5. The order of rows does not mater

2NF: in 1NF and the followings
  1. All attributes are dependent on full primary key
  2. No non-key column is dependent on only a protion of the primary key
  3. Each non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key
  4. Each attribute that is not in the primary key provides a fact that depends on the entire key.
  NOTE:
    1~4 are saying the same thing===>Solve the compound primary key issue
    The relations in 1NF without a compound primary key are automatically in 2NF
    Handling --> Non-repeating Field values

3NF: 
  1. Each non-primary key attribute provides a fact that is independent of other non-key attributes and depends only on the key.
  2. Each non-key attribute is dependent on the PK and only on the PK
  3. All non-key attributes are not dependent on any other non-key attributes
  4. The only determinants are candidate keys (Boyce-Cold Normal Form: BCNF)
